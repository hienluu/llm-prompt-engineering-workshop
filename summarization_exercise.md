#### Transcript - Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want
```
Strategize Your Life takes the principles of strategy, and also strategic thinking, used in the world's boardrooms and applies them to your own life. 
By going through a seven-step program, you will have developed your own life strategy on a single page. Where did this idea come from? I spent almost half my life 
at the Boston Consulting Group doing countless strategy projects for our clients. Before that, I studied physics at management. In physics, and also in nature, 
you often get new insights by applying methods from one discipline to another discipline, such as the mechanics of fluids to the flow of traffic to predict traffic jams. 
What if I took strategic thinking and applied it to my own life? That was the birth of Strategize Your Life. What is a life strategy? 
Corporate strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions an organization to win. 
Now, if you substitute corporate with life, you would get life strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions a person to win. 
But life is not about winning. Life is about living a great life. So our definition of a life strategy is life strategy is an integrated set of choices 
that positions a person to live a great life. A typical corporate strategy project has seven steps. Number one, how does the organization define success? 
This translates for the individual, how do I define a great life? Two, what is the organization's purpose? What is my life purpose? 
Three, what is the organization's vision? What is my life vision? Four, how does the organization assess its business portfolio? 
How do I assess my life portfolio? What is actually a life portfolio? Number five, what can the organization, and also I, learn from best practices and benchmarks? 
Number six, what portfolio choices should the organization make? What life portfolio choices should I make? This is the central step where all the first five steps come together. 
So where you define your integrated set of choices that gives you the way towards a great life. 
And finally, step seven, how can the organization, and also I, ensure successful, sustained change? The symmetry is really striking here. 
How do you define a great life? How do I define a great life? Most people think through education, through social media, it's about money, fame and power. 
But only, let's say, money has to a certain extent only in effect because you feel yourself hedonic adaptation. So if you get a pay rise, very quickly your 
happiness goes down to initial level. On top, you have also social comparison, which means you always compare yourself with other people in certain areas. 
Money, fame, power has only a certain effect. What then? A lot of other methodologies and frameworks came up. And one of the newest comes from positive psychology 
from Professor Seligman, which is called PERMA, which was later developed into PERMA-V. PERMA-V are six letters. It's P stands for positive emotions. 
So do I have a lot of contentment in my life? E stands for engagement. So am I feeling in a flow of what I'm doing? It could be a great project. 
It could be a great hobby. R stands for relationships. So deep relationships with your significant other, your family, and also with other people. 
M in PERMA is about meaning. So making the world a better place. A is achievement. So do you have a lot of, let's say, levels of achievements? 
So goals that you achieve. And the V stands for vitality. So there's an old saying, if you are healthy, you have 1,000 problems, but if you are ill, 
you have only 1 problem. So this is a model that you can adjust also and also to contemplate with some other parameters. 
How do I assess my life portfolio? In corporate portfolio management, we elevate business units in which to invest capital with respect to certain parameters, 
like market growth or market share. If you plot these two parameters on the x and y-axis, you get the famous 2-by-2 BCG portfolio matrix. 
Now, what is the equivalent of a business unit in life? Here we propose strategic life units in which you can invest time, money, and energy. 
Now, a week has 168 hours. 24 times 7. How do you spend these hours? First, you can spend it with your significant other, our first strategic life unit. 
Yes, I know what you are thinking. Only a consultant could come up with the idea of calling your significant other strategic life unit one. But wait. 
Bear with me. Now, you could also spend it with your family, with sports activities, with jobs, with your faith, and with a lot of other things. 
All in all, we have identified 16 strategic life units that we bundle into 6 strategic life areas. Now we need three pieces of information. 
Number one, take an average week of the previous year and divide it among these 16 strategic life units. So how much time do you spend on each of them? 
Secondly, rate the importance of each of these strategic life units on a scale from 0 to 10. 
And finally, define the level of satisfaction with each of these 16 strategic life units. So 0, not at all satisfied. 10, very satisfied. 
So how satisfied are you with your relationships, with your job, with your physical health, et cetera? 
Now you can plot all these pieces of information in a simple 2-by-2 matrix. We call it the strategic life portfolio, where you plot importance on the y-axis, 
satisfaction on the x-axis, and then you plot your 16 strategic life units. And the size of the bubble is roughly proportional to the time invested. 
Let me give you an example. And this is an example of Tony, an engineer. He went through the exercise. In the upper left, you find four topics. 
Upper left means high important and low satisfaction. So these are your urgent strategic life units. And for Tony, it was significant other because he didn't 
have one at the moment. And therefore, you can hardly see this dot. You find mental health. You find societal engagement. 
And you find education and learning. 95% of our workshop participants had at least one topic in this upper left corner. 
High importance, low satisfaction. And many had, really, two or three of them in there. And you find a bigger bubble on the lower right side. 
So a lot of time invested in online entertainment. Now do the same. Go through the exercise. Draft your first sketch. It only takes you 20 to 30 minutes. 
And it will be very enlightening. What portfolio choices can I make? Now you rated the importance, you rated the satisfaction of each of these strategic life units, 
and you allocated the time. Actually, you can change all three parameters. Importance might stay a little bit longer on the same level. 
But satisfaction level and size of the bubble is absolutely under your control. In the upper left, you find topics where you are either not satisfied with or 
where you don't spend enough time on. And it could be both, quite honestly, in certain areas. If you have a big issue on relationships and y
ou say you are not really satisfied with this, a quick win would be just to reach out and reconnect with three friends from school. 
Go on your phone, give them a call, and then see how this might evolve. For a lot of people, social media is a real problem. And they spend a lot of hours there. 
So usually, you have a big bubble there. The question is how to reduce this. 
And I had people in our workshops who just deleted in the workshop their Instagram or their TikTok account because this would free up so much time for other activities. 
What is the right portfolio? So a right portfolio we would see as a portfolio that is aligned to your dimensions of a great life, that supports your purpose, and also supports your vision. 
Very often it means that you have a lot of big bubbles in the upper right area. These are your very important topics, but you are also very satisfied 
with it and you spend a lot of time there. Where do I go from here? This is not yet your life strategy. It's only one step out of seven steps you have to go through. 
Can we really come up with a strategy for your life? Yes, we would say. Even in uncertain times, you need to know your direction. 
As the stoic philosopher Seneca said, "If you do not know which port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable." But you have to be open for opportunities and serendipity. 
Now you could say, isn't a great life a chain of lucky events? Fortunately, Seneca said something to this too. "Luck is when preparation meets opportunity." 
And strategize your life helps you with the preparation.

#### Transcript - The Luck Formula: The Secret to Being in the Right Place at Right Time

```
so what if I told you that luck is actually a myth then instead of waiting for it to find you you can actually create yourself now think about it
how many times in your life have you thought something happened to you because you were lucky but what if that wasn't luck what if you had more
control than you think I used to say that my successes in life were due to luck uh I got into my dream University studying computer science
I made it on the financial times as top 50 with inspiring women in Tech in the UK and then the year after top 50 in Europe and I also got to meet Hillary Clinton
now you might think that it's because she's hardworking but I was surrounded by so many hardworking people and even my parents would joke my Dad's here
in the audience that I must have some horseshoe around me because things just seem to fall right into place even though my journey was chaotic
or turbulent I started wondering actually luck is more than just a random chance now we've all heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that
a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could set off or tornado in Texas now let's think about our own life could a small action a random conversation
or a bold decision set off a chain reaction that could lead to Monumental change that's what happened to me so let me tell you a story so one day my
my mom mistook an Asian lady with a white dog for me in Hy Park and as you can see we had two very similar looking adorable white dogs
the lady's name was Tata and we laughed about the whole situation but instead of letting her walk away I decided let me introduce myself
why not just wanted to make a new friend and uh instead of letting her walk away I wanted to ask her for lunch so a month later we went for lunch we
shared our stories and we were inspired by each other as female founders and she introduced me to the tedex team and that's why I'm standing here
today partially because of my dog now you might think oh she's lucky to be here and yes I am lucky but this wasn't luck just falling into my lap
I made this happen and standing before you today I feel privileged and it makes me quite emotional because if you know me I'm a little bit of
a shy person so all it took was a single moment of Courage a decision to step out of my comfort zone at the time and that's how L me here today and
that's when I realized actually some of the biggest opportunities that will come into your life it's not going to come when you're 100% prepared or
when you're perfect it's by saying yes to those little moments beforehand and that is the first ingredient of my formula opportunity or as I like to
call it being a yes woman or a yes man and now for the next part I had a long hard thing of what kind of analogy I wanted to use to best describe this
and this is what I came up with a surfer so picture this you're pounding out in the ocean the perfect wave is coming towards you but there's a catch
you've never learned how to surf in your life and it doesn't matter how perfect that wave is you're not prepared so you're never going to be able
to write it and that to me is what the definition of luck is luck are these occasional waves that come and go and it's waiting for that right
Surfer to write it now let's take for example public speaking so I used to be terrified of it and still am a little bit um but in the past
I was petrified and I was realizing that fear was really holding me back from so many opportunities and so six years ago I participated in one of
the biggest university competitions at Imperial College London and I was competing against phds and mbas and I was just a little Master student
I was so nervous and I did everything I could to practice I practiced in front of the mirror in front of my friends in front of my
friend's dog and then came the big day I took a deep breath went up to stage and everything was going smoothly and then it happened in this screenshot
of this video clip I completely froze for an eternity I look back at the screen look back at the audience I look back at the screen I didn't know
what to do and I looked like a deer in headlights and in my head I was thinking completely blown this like I don't even think I'm going to get
third place and that was my mindset at the time I was like I just wanted to aim for third place and so got down on stage went back to my
seat feeling quite embarrassed about the whole ordeal let all the pitches go through and then it was time for them to announce the winners
they announced third place wasn't me second place wasn't us and then first place and the winner was me seriously I honestly was so shocked by
this moment and I'm not joking because this was my face when I won literally the definition of happy tears literally and this looks super funny all over
the news articles um and this is such a nostalgic moment for me because it's an old company so it was such a long time ago but um I realized that day
that even when you think you've completely blown it it's one step towards preparation one step towards your next big moment and that day I felt
a change in me I felt mentally wired even differently and I was really curious to understand the psychology and the science behind this and
this is where I came across the term neuroplasticity so neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize Itself by forming new neural connections
so when you literally face your fears you're not only getting ready for the next opportunity you're reshaping your brain and you're biologically enhancing yourself
to increase your capacities to succeed and I I just find that fascinating and that's the second part of my formula preparation and now for the
final spice to my formula I want everyone to have a think about the next question a personal question to yourself how often do you let fear or
doubt stop you from putting yourself out there now instead of waiting for that perfect moment or that right circumstance What If instead
we made ourselves visible and created these moments ourselves so when I became the CEO of a fintech startup I actually had minimal experience in finance
I was my expertise was in computer science I at the time didn't know the difference between a bull market and an actual bull at the time but
I saw an opportunity and I wanted to go for it so I spent hours learning the basics for months and months I went out and met as many experts as possible and
most importantly I was visible I was hungry I found any industry event in London that I could go to that related to that and that ended up exceeding
All my expectations we ended up in the accelerator of the biggest bank in the UK followed by being admitted into uh one of the big four consulting
firms accelerators and our biggest break yet was we got um an investment from one of the biggest American accelerators in the world so
we were the 12 startups that were chosen in London and to give you perspective less than 1% out of 177,000 global applications get accepted a year
so we apply three times just so you know but um was that luck or was it being visible and putting yourself out there over and over and over again
so have a hard thing to yourself what's stopping you from showing up and being seen right now in whatever you're doing at the moment and that is
the completed formula so the biggest takeaway that I want everyone to leave here with today is that the next time you're feeling
unmotivated you're feeling a certain event meeting or occasion maybe doesn't sit well with you right now you're not really feeling it
I would say think again you never know of what something that you might do today could open doors for you tomorrow or the future so
please we need to stop thinking that luck is about chance we need to get out there create our own luck and be your own lucky charm thank you
