#### Transcript - Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want
```
 Strategize Your Life takes the principles of strategy, and also strategic thinking, used in 
the world's boardrooms and applies them to your own life. By going through a seven-step program, 
you will have developed your own life strategy on a single page. Where did this idea come from? 
I spent almost half my life at the Boston Consulting Group doing countless strategy projects 
for our clients. Before that, I studied physics at management. In physics, and also in nature, 
you often get new insights by applying methods from one discipline to another discipline, 
such as the mechanics of fluids to the flow of traffic to predict traffic jams. What if I 
took strategic thinking and applied it to my own life? That was the birth of Strategize Your Life. 
What is a life strategy? Corporate strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions 
an organization to win. Now, if you substitute corporate with life, you would get life strategy is 
an integrated set of choices that positions a person to win. But life is not about winning. 
Life is about living a great life. So our definition of a life strategy is life strategy is 
an integrated set of choices that positions a person to live a great life. A typical corporate 
strategy project has seven steps. Number one, how does the organization define success? 
This translates for the individual, how do I define a great life? Two, what is 
the organization's purpose? What is my life purpose? Three, what is the organization's vision? 
What is my life vision? Four, how does the organization assess its business portfolio? 
How do I assess my life portfolio? What is actually a life portfolio? Number five, 
what can the organization, and also I, learn from best practices and benchmarks? 
Number six, what portfolio choices should the organization make? What life portfolio choices 
should I make? This is the central step where all the first five steps come together. 
So where you define your integrated set of choices that gives you the way towards a great life. 
And finally, step seven, how can the organization, and also I, ensure successful, sustained change? 
The symmetry is really striking here. How do you define a great life? How do I define 
a great life? Most people think through education, through social media, it's about money, 
fame and power. But only, let's say, money has to a certain extent only in effect because 
you feel yourself hedonic adaptation. So if you get a pay rise, very quickly your happiness 
goes down to initial level. On top, you have also social comparison, which means you always 
compare yourself with other people in certain areas. Money, fame, power has only a certain 
effect. What then? A lot of other methodologies and frameworks came up. And one of 
the newest comes from positive psychology from Professor Seligman, which is called PERMA, 
which was later developed into PERMA-V. PERMA-V are six letters. It's P stands 
for positive emotions. So do I have a lot of contentment in my life? E stands for engagement. 
So am I feeling in a flow of what I'm doing? It could be a great project. It could be a great hobby. 
R stands for relationships. So deep relationships with your significant other, your family, 
and also with other people. M in PERMA is about meaning. So making the world a better place. 
A is achievement. So do you have a lot of, let's say, levels of achievements? So goals 
that you achieve. And the V stands for vitality. So there's an old saying, if you are healthy, 
you have 1,000 problems, but if you are ill, you have only 1 problem. So this is a model 
that you can adjust also and also to contemplate with some other parameters. How do I assess 
my life portfolio? In corporate portfolio management, we elevate business units in which 
to invest capital with respect to certain parameters, like market growth or market share. 
If you plot these two parameters on the x and y-axis, you get the famous 2-by-2 BCG portfolio 
matrix. Now, what is the equivalent of a business unit in life? Here we propose strategic 
life units in which you can invest time, money, and energy. Now, a week has 168 hours. 24 times 7. 
How do you spend these hours? First, you can spend it with your significant other, our first 
strategic life unit. Yes, I know what you are thinking. Only a consultant could come up with 
the idea of calling your significant other strategic life unit one. But wait. Bear with me. 
Now, you could also spend it with your family, with sports activities, with jobs, with your faith, 
and with a lot of other things. All in all, we have identified 16 strategic life units that 
we bundle into 6 strategic life areas. Now we need three pieces of information. Number one, 
take an average week of the previous year and divide it among these 16 strategic life units. 
So how much time do you spend on each of them? Secondly, rate the importance of each of 
these strategic life units on a scale from 0 to 10. And finally, define the level of satisfaction 
with each of these 16 strategic life units. So 0, not at all satisfied. 10, very satisfied. 
So how satisfied are you with your relationships, with your job, with your physical health, et cetera? 
Now you can plot all these pieces of information in a simple 2-by-2 matrix. We call it 
the strategic life portfolio, where you plot importance on the y-axis, satisfaction on the x-axis, 
and then you plot your 16 strategic life units. And the size of the bubble is roughly proportional 
to the time invested. Let me give you an example. And this is an example of Tony, an engineer. 
He went through the exercise. In the upper left, you find four topics. Upper left means high important 
and low satisfaction. So these are your urgent strategic life units. And for Tony, it was significant 
other because he didn't have one at the moment. And therefore, you can hardly see this dot. 
You find mental health. You find societal engagement. And you find education and learning. 
95% of our workshop participants had at least one topic in this upper left corner. High importance, 
low satisfaction. And many had, really, two or three of them in there. And you find a bigger bubble 
on the lower right side. So a lot of time invested in online entertainment. Now do the same. 
Go through the exercise. Draft your first sketch. It only takes you 20 to 30 minutes. 
And it will be very enlightening. What portfolio choices can I make? Now you rated the importance, 
you rated the satisfaction of each of these strategic life units, and you allocated the time. 
Actually, you can change all three parameters. Importance might stay a little bit longer on 
the same level. But satisfaction level and size of the bubble is absolutely under your control. 
In the upper left, you find topics where you are either not satisfied with or where you don't 
spend enough time on. And it could be both, quite honestly, in certain areas. If you have a big issue 
on relationships and y ou say you are not really satisfied with this, a quick win would be just 
to reach out and reconnect with three friends from school. Go on your phone, give them a call, 
and then see how this might evolve. For a lot of people, social media is a real problem. 
And they spend a lot of hours there. So usually, you have a big bubble there. The question is how 
to reduce this. And I had people in our workshops who just deleted in the workshop their Instagram or 
their TikTok account because this would free up so much time for other activities. What is the 
right portfolio? So a right portfolio we would see as a portfolio that is aligned to your dimensions 
of a great life, that supports your purpose, and also supports your vision. Very often it means 
that you have a lot of big bubbles in the upper right area. These are your very important topics, 
but you are also very satisfied with it and you spend a lot of time there. Where do I go from here? 
This is not yet your life strategy. It's only one step out of seven steps you have to go through. 
Can we really come up with a strategy for your life? Yes, we would say. Even in uncertain times, 
you need to know your direction. As the stoic philosopher Seneca said, "If you do not know which 
port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable." But you have to be open for opportunities and 
serendipity. Now you could say, isn't a great life a chain of lucky events? Fortunately, 
Seneca said something to this too. "Luck is when preparation meets opportunity." And strategize 
your life helps you with the preparation.

#### Transcript - The Luck Formula: The Secret to Being in the Right Place at Right Time

```
so what if I told you that luck is actually a myth then instead of waiting for it to find you 
you can actually create yourself now think about it how many times in your life have you thought 
something happened to you because you were lucky but what if that wasn't luck what if you had 
more control than you think I used to say that my successes in life were due to luck uh 
I got into my dream University studying computer science I made it on the financial times as 
top 50 with inspiring women in Tech in the UK and then the year after top 50 in Europe and 
I also got to meet Hillary Clinton now you might think that it's because she's hardworking 
but I was surrounded by so many hardworking people and even my parents would joke my 
Dad's here in the audience that I must have some horseshoe around me because things just seem 
to fall right into place even though my journey was chaotic or turbulent I started wondering 
actually luck is more than just a random chance now we've all heard of the butterfly effect 
it's the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could set off or tornado in 
Texas now let's think about our own life could a small action a random conversation 
or a bold decision set off a chain reaction that could lead to Monumental change that's 
what happened to me so let me tell you a story so one day my my mom mistook an Asian lady 
with a white dog for me in Hy Park and as you can see we had two very similar looking 
adorable white dogs the lady's name was Tata and we laughed about the whole situation 
but instead of letting her walk away I decided let me introduce myself why not just wanted 
to make a new friend and uh instead of letting her walk away I wanted to ask her for 
lunch so a month later we went for lunch we shared our stories and we were inspired 
by each other as female founders and she introduced me to the tedex team and that's 
why I'm standing here today partially because of my dog now you might think oh she's lucky 
to be here and yes I am lucky but this wasn't luck just falling into my lap I made this happen 
and standing before you today I feel privileged and it makes me quite emotional because 
if you know me I'm a little bit of a shy person so all it took was a single moment of 
Courage a decision to step out of my comfort zone at the time and that's how L me here today 
and that's when I realized actually some of the biggest opportunities that will come 
into your life it's not going to come when you're 100% prepared or when you're perfect 
it's by saying yes to those little moments beforehand and that is the first ingredient 
of my formula opportunity or as I like to call it being a yes woman or a yes man and now 
for the next part I had a long hard thing of what kind of analogy I wanted to use 
to best describe this and this is what I came up with a surfer so picture this you're pounding 
out in the ocean the perfect wave is coming towards you but there's a catch you've never learned 
how to surf in your life and it doesn't matter how perfect that wave is you're not prepared 
so you're never going to be able to write it and that to me is what the definition of 
luck is luck are these occasional waves that come and go and it's waiting for that right Surfer 
to write it now let's take for example public speaking so I used to be terrified of it and 
still am a little bit um but in the past I was petrified and I was realizing that fear was 
really holding me back from so many opportunities and so six years ago I participated 
in one of the biggest university competitions at Imperial College London and I was competing 
against phds and mbas and I was just a little Master student I was so nervous and I did everything 
I could to practice I practiced in front of the mirror in front of my friends in front of my friend's 
dog and then came the big day I took a deep breath went up to stage and everything was going smoothly 
and then it happened in this screenshot of this video clip I completely froze for an eternity 
I look back at the screen look back at the audience I look back at the screen I didn't know what 
to do and I looked like a deer in headlights and in my head I was thinking completely blown this 
like I don't even think I'm going to get third place and that was my mindset at the time I was like 
I just wanted to aim for third place and so got down on stage went back to my seat feeling 
quite embarrassed about the whole ordeal let all the pitches go through and then it was time 
for them to announce the winners they announced third place wasn't me second place wasn't us and 
then first place and the winner was me seriously I honestly was so shocked by this moment and 
I'm not joking because this was my face when I won literally the definition of happy tears literally 
and this looks super funny all over the news articles um and this is such a nostalgic moment for 
me because it's an old company so it was such a long time ago but um I realized that day that even 
when you think you've completely blown it it's one step towards preparation one step towards 
your next big moment and that day I felt a change in me I felt mentally wired even differently 
and I was really curious to understand the psychology and the science behind this and this is 
where I came across the term neuroplasticity so neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize 
Itself by forming new neural connections so when you literally face your fears you're not only 
getting ready for the next opportunity you're reshaping your brain and you're biologically enhancing 
yourself to increase your capacities to succeed and I I just find that fascinating and that's 
the second part of my formula preparation and now for the final spice to my formula I want everyone 
to have a think about the next question a personal question to yourself how often do you let fear 
or doubt stop you from putting yourself out there now instead of waiting for that perfect moment 
or that right circumstance What If instead we made ourselves visible and created these moments 
ourselves so when I became the CEO of a fintech startup I actually had minimal experience in 
finance I was my expertise was in computer science I at the time didn't know the difference between 
a bull market and an actual bull at the time but I saw an opportunity and I wanted to go for 
it so I spent hours learning the basics for months and months I went out and met as many experts 
as possible and most importantly I was visible I was hungry I found any industry event in London 
that I could go to that related to that and that ended up exceeding All my expectations we ended 
up in the accelerator of the biggest bank in the UK followed by being admitted into uh one of 
the big four consulting firms accelerators and our biggest break yet was we got um an investment 
from one of the biggest American accelerators in the world so we were the 12 startups that were 
chosen in London and to give you perspective less than 1% out of 177,000 global applications get 
accepted a year so we apply three times just so you know but um was that luck or was it being 
visible and putting yourself out there over and over and over again so have a hard thing to 
yourself what's stopping you from showing up and being seen right now in whatever you're doing 
at the moment and that is the completed formula so the biggest takeaway that I want everyone 
to leave here with today is that the next time you're feeling unmotivated you're feeling a certain 
event meeting or occasion maybe doesn't sit well with you right now you're not really feeling it 
I would say think again you never know of what something that you might do today could open doors 
for you tomorrow or the future so please we need to stop thinking that luck is about chance 
we need to get out there create our own luck and be your own lucky charm thank you

#### Transcript - #1 Best Meal to Clean Out Your Arteries
```
I want to tell you the number one best meal to clear out your arteries I spent a lot of time talking about
what not to eat today we're going to talk about what to eat this is going to be quite surprising for most of
you because it's not going to follow the traditional American Heart Association idea of what you should be
eating to figure out what The endothelial layer to eat we have to really look at the layer of tissue that's
exposed to the blood going through the arteries and that's called the endothelial layer it controls your
blood pressure both high and low it also acts as a filter especially as the blood vessels go through
the kidney because that's what the kidney is it's a filter also does other things like preventing
clots it has an immune component one other very unique thing about it is that the fuel that it prefers is
actually glucose realize you don't have to consume glucose to feed it your body can very easily
make glucose because it uses glucose as the primary fuel that means it also needs insulin to hold
this glucose in which means that inside of the artery is very susceptible to problems with insulin
the majority of the population has this insulin resistance problem why is that so important to know
because if you have an insulin deficiency you're going to have a deficiency of fuel how do you develop
insulin resistance by consuming things that increase insulin and that would be the chronic consumption
of carbohydrates snacking both snacking too much and the consumption of too many carbohydrates
creates a situation of insulin resistance the next thing I want to talk Nitric oxide about is
nitric oxide the nitric oxide relaxes the vessels they help keep the arteries from becoming stiff
they really support that endothelial layer of the inside of the arteries vitamin D is another thing
that triggers nitric oxide vitamin D is so powerful and potent at helping support that endothelial layer
this is why so many people that are low in vitamin D have a problem with high blood pressure why
because vitamin D tree supports nitric oxide there's a couple other things that trigger nitric oxide
one is Arginine this is why a lot of people are taking that as a supplement to help lower your blood pressure
another interesting thing about nitric oxide is testosterone increases nitric oxide unfortunately nowadays
the big reason why people have low testosterone is all the Plastics in the environment because that
plastic can directly shut down your testosterone Magnesium and clogged arteries another thing
that's really important increasing nitric oxide is magnesium magnesium tends to relax muscle spasms tends
to reduce cortisol and think about what cortisol does it increases stress what's going to happen
to your blood pressure it's going to increase your blood pressure the other thing that's interesting
about magnesium is that magnesium is a very potent thing to keep calcium from building up inside
the arteries magnesium and vitamin D can help keep that calcium from even ending up in the arteries in
the first Place vitamin K2 also keeps calcium from building up in the artery the first thing I'm presenting
to you is the various nutrients that are really important in supporting this artery and then we're going
to translate that to the best meal I always like to take what mainstream recommends to eat to prevent heart problems
and really look at that but in the opposite direction because if we take a look at Cheerios you can see
this little certification thing right here which says American Heart assoc Association certified meets
criteria for heart healthy food all you need to have to get this little certification is if 51% of
those ingredients are whole grains you can have refined grains in there you can have sugars in there
and it's still heart healthy I don't think so I also need to show you another heart healthy thing
that's recommended seed oils that's what they recommend if we look at the mainstream recommendation
they basically recommend whole Gra rins unsaturated seed oils for the heart both of those items will start
to raise insulin we're also told to avoid saturated fat things with saturated fat have cholesterol and
that could damage the heart and clog Our arteries this is why people say you need to avoid red meat
but they're not against coconut oil one teaspoon of coconut oil has more cholesterol than 7 o of a steak
but we're not against coconut oil but we are against meat there's a tremendous amount of uh false information
in relationship to what's good for the heart the statistics on heart disease are getting worse and worse
and worse what mainstream is recommending is not The best meal to clean out your arteries working the best meal
that you can eat to support a healthy artery to help support a healthy heart the first thing to know is
we want to consume something that does not mess up our insulin we're going to have to go low carb ketogenic
is going to be best because with ketones you can by pass this instant resistance and feed that layer of
the inside the artery and make sure it gets enough fuel Foods that unclog arteries the primary part of
this meal is going to be red meat the exact thing that they tell you not to eat you can do a hamburger or something
like that I would just make sure it's grass-fed if you're going to have a burger uh I would highly recommend
you melt some cheese on it I would find some raw cheese because raw cheese is higher in vitamin K2 red meat
is also loaded with zinc which will directly improve your testosterone as far as how much it could range
anywhere from 6 o to 8 O the mistake a lot of people make is they start going plantbased protein that are
not very bioavailable well just think about what the heart is it's like a muscle and we need to give it
the raw material to help support it to help heal it now let's get into the second part of this meal and
I'm going to recommend that you have a salad I primarily do arugula which also will increase nitric oxide
it also has vitamin C that's good for the arteries it also has some vitamin E the other thing that can help
you is pumpkin seeds pumpkin seeds have high magnesium high zinc and selenium pumpkin seeds can increase nitric oxide
maybe just take a handful of pumpkin seeds with your meal Vitamin D for heart health the last thing I want to bring
up is vitamin D to support a healthy heart there's nothing more powerful than the vitamin D3 it's virtually impossible
to get your vitamin D from food unless you're an Eskimo and you're eating all this seal fat which you're probably
not so you're going to have to get it from the sun when you're getting the Sun get a lot of it just don't get burnt
in the winter you can't get it from the Sun so you're going to have to take it as a supplement as a maintenance dosage
you need at least 10,000 IUS every single day that will greatly help your heart and many other things
thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
