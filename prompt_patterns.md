## Prompt Patterns

### Ask for Input
```
From now on, translate anything I write into a series emojis.
Ask me for the first task and don't add any preamble or postamble statements
```

#### Template Pattern
```
I am going to give you a template for your output. CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders.
Fill in the placeholders with your output.  Please make sure to preserve the overall formatting of the template.
My template is:

****Question**** QUESTION
****Answer:**** ANSWER

I will now provide the data to format in the next prompt and you will create ten questions using the template. 
```

#### Outline Expansion Pattern
```
Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for
which bullet point you should expand on.  Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select.
At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next.

Ask me for what to outline
```

#### Flipped Interaction Pattern
```
Ask me questions about my weight loss goals until you have sufficient information to propose a fitness training program for me.
When you have enough information, show me the fitness training program.

Ask me the first question.
```
