Ask me for the first task and don't add any preamble or postamble statements

### Flipped Interaction
```
In the context of prompt engineering patterns,  here is an example of the  the flipped interaction pattern:

- Ask me questions about my weight loss goals until you have sufficient information to propose a fitness training program for me.
When you have enough information, show me the fitness training program.

Now, I would like you to come up with 3 examples that related to couples and make sure they are funny
```
